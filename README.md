# knapsack_solver.py
A python cli program that solves [knapsack problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)

The Algorithm was originally implemented by my friend Lorenzo Lopez using the [PulP library](https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/).
I refactored its code to transform the algorithm into a good cli program.
